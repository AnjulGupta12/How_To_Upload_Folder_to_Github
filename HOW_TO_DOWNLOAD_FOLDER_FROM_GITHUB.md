GitHub's vscode based editor.

Pros:
1. doesn't require any extra tool like svn or API tokens.
2. No limit on size of content
3. Saves as a directory or file, and not archive.

Instructions
1. Go to any repo. (ex. https://github.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator/tree/master/software)
2. Press . or replace .com with .dev in URL to open the repo in GitHub's internal editor
3. In Explorer pane (left side or press Ctrl+Shift+E), Right click on the required file/folder and select download.
4. In the Select Folder dialog box, choose the directory on your disk under which you want the selected file/folder to exist.

Note
I tried other solutions like in accepted answer but,
1. Don't want to install and learn svn only for this.
2. Other tools like Download Directory, Refined GitHub, GitZip, DownGit either require API tokens or cannot download large directories.
